<i>"As a first-generation American woman in data science, I believes that representation is vital to improving the quality of research and access to health resources. I am passionate about creating more equitable communities by improving access to resources and influencing policy through data analytics. To drive meaningful impact in this area, I have dedicated time during my undergraduate career to mentor SF Bay Area middle and high school youth through programs like SF Promise and AVID. I continue my dedication to mentorship through the R.I.S.E. (Resilience, Inclusion, Solidarity, and Empowerment) program at Columbia University"</i>
